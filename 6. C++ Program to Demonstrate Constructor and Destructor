AIM:
To write a C++ program that demonstrates the working of constructor and destructor.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.
Create a class containing a constructor and destructor.
Constructor should display a message when an object is created.
Destructor should display a message when an object is destroyed.
Create an object inside main().
End the program.

PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo {
public:
    Demo() {
        cout << "Constructor is called" << endl;
    }

    ~Demo() {
        cout << "Destructor is called" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Demo obj;  
    cout << "Inside main function" << endl;
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
Constructor is called
Inside main function
Destructor is called

RESULT:
The program successfully demonstrated the execution of constructor and destructor.

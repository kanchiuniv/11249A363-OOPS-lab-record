Aim:
To find the greatest of two numbers.

Algorithm:
Start
Read two numbers
If a > b → a is largest
Else → b is largest
Stop

program:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a, b;
    cout<<"Enter two numbers: ";
    cin>>a>>b;
    if(a > b)
        cout<<"Largest number = "<<a;
    else
        cout<<"Largest number = "<<b;
    return 0;
}

Sample Output:
Enter two numbers: 10 25
Largest number = 25

Result:

Aim:
To write a C++ program to demonstrate multiple inheritance.

Algorithm:
Start the program.
Create two base classes.
Create a derived class inheriting from both classes.
Create object of derived class.
Access and display data from both base classes.
End the program.

Program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class A {
public:
    void showA() {
        cout << "Base Class A\n";
    }
};
class B {
public:
    void showB() {
        cout << "Base Class B\n";
    }
};
class C : public A, public B {
public:
    void showC() {
        cout << "Derived Class C\n";
    }
};
int main() {
    C obj;
    obj.showA();
    obj.showB();
    obj.showC();
    return 0;
}

Output:
Base Class A
Base Class B
Derived Class C

Result:
Multiple inheritance was successfully demonstrated.

Aim:
To write a C++ program to demonstrate memory management using new and delete operators.

Algorithm:
Start the program.
Declare a pointer variable.
Use new to allocate memory dynamically for an integer.
Store a value in the allocated memory.
Display the value.
Use delete to release the memory.
End the program.

Program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int *ptr;

    ptr = new int;          // dynamic allocation
    *ptr = 50;

    cout << "Value stored in dynamic memory: " << *ptr << endl;

    delete ptr;             // free memory
    cout << "Memory released successfully.";

    return 0;
}

Output:
Value stored in dynamic memory: 50
Memory released successfully.

Result:
Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using new and delete were successfully implemented.

Aim:
To display book information using class and objects with member functions defined outside the class.

Algorithm:
Start
Create a class Book with title, author, and price.
Declare member functions inside class but define them outside.
Get details from user and print them.
Stop.

program:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Book {
    string title, author;
    float price;
public:
    void getData();
    void display();
};

void Book::getData() {
    cout<<"Enter Book Title: ";
    cin>>title;
    cout<<"Enter Author Name: ";
    cin>>author;
    cout<<"Enter Price: ";
    cin>>price;
}

void Book::display() {
    cout<<"\n--- Book Details ---\n";
    cout<<"Title: "<<title<<endl;
    cout<<"Author: "<<author<<endl;
    cout<<"Price: "<<price<<endl;
}

int main() {
    Book b;
    b.getData();
    b.display();
    return 0;
}

Output:

Enter Book Title: CPP
Enter Author Name: Balagurusamy
Enter Price: 450
--- Book Details ---
Title: CPP
Author: Balagurusamy
Price: 450

Result:

The program displays book details with member functions defined outside the class.

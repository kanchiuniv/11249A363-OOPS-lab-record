Aim:
To write a C++ program that shows how static data members and static member functions work within a class.

Algorithm:
Start the program.
Create a class with:
one normal data member,
one static data member,
one static function.
one function to set and display data.
Increment the static data member inside the constructor.
Create multiple objects to observe the static member behavior.
Call the static member function using class name.
End the program.

Program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Student {
    int rollno;
    static int count;   // static data member
public:
    Student(int r) {
        rollno = r;
        count++;        // increment static count
    }
    void display() {
        cout << "Roll No: " << rollno << endl;
    }
    static void showCount() {   // static function
        cout << "Total Students: " << count << endl;
    }
};
// Initialize static member
int Student::count = 0;
int main() {
    Student s1(101);
    Student s2(102);
    Student s3(103);
    s1.display();
    s2.display();
    s3.display();
    Student::showCount();   // calling static member function
    return 0;
}

Output:
Roll No: 101
Roll No: 102
Roll No: 103
Total Students: 3

Result:
The program successfully demonstrated the use of static data members and static member functions, showing that static members retain values across all objects.

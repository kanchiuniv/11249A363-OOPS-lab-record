Aim:
To write a C++ program demonstrating exception handling using try, throw, and catch.

Algorithm:
Start program.
Read a number from the user.
If number is zero, throw an exception.
Catch the exception and display an error message.
Otherwise, perform division and display result.
End program.

Program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;

    try {
        if (b == 0)
            throw b;

        cout << "Division = " << a / b << endl;
    }
    catch (int x) {
        cout << "Error: Division by zero is not allowed!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Output:
Enter two numbers: 10 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
(OR)
Enter two numbers: 20 5
Division = 4

Result:
Exception handling techniques using try, throw, and catch were successfully implemented.
Exception handling techniques using try, throw, and catch were successfully implemented.

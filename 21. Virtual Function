Aim:
To write a C++ program that demonstrates the concept of virtual functions using runtime polymorphism.

Algorithm:
Start the program.
Create a base class with a virtual function.
Create a derived class overriding the virtual function.
Create a base class pointer and assign the address of a derived class object.
Call the virtual function using the base pointer.
Observe runtime binding.
End the program.

Program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Base class show() function" << endl;
    }
};
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "Derived class show() function" << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    Base *bptr;
    Derived d;
    bptr = &d;
    bptr->show();   // Runtime polymorphism
    return 0;
}

Output:
Derived class show() function

Result:
Virtual functions were successfully demonstrated using runtime polymorphism.

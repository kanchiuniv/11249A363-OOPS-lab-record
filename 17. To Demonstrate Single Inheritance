Aim:
To write a C++ program to demonstrate the concept of single inheritance.

Algorithm:
Start the program.
Define a base class with data members and member functions.
Define a derived class that inherits from the base class.
Create an object of the derived class.
Use the derived class object to access both base and derived class members.
Display the results.
End the program.

Program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Person {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    void getData() {
        name = "John";
        age = 20;
    }
};

class Student : public Person {
public:
    int roll;

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
        cout << "Roll No: " << roll << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;
    s.getData();
    s.roll = 101;
    s.display();
    return 0;
}

Output:
Name: John
Age: 20
Roll No: 101

Result:
Single inheritance was successfully demonstrated.
